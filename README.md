## FON Smart Chain

FON Smart Chain is a brand new public chain. The FON Smart Chain relies on a system of 21 active validators with Proof-of-Stake (APoS) consensus that supports short block times and lower fees. The validator candidates with the most stakes will become validators and produce blocks. Double-signature detection and other slashing logic ensure security, stability, and chain finality. In addition to the 21 active validators, FSC will introduce more validators, such as another 20 inactive validators, as backups into the validator set, which will be referred to as "candidates".

FON Smart Chain starts its development based on go-ethereum fork. So you may see many toolings, binaries and also docs are based on Ethereum ones, such as the name “geth”.

Candidates will have bad influence in the FSC Mainnet and charge gas fees, but have much less chance than the official sponsor's 21 sets of elections. Unavailable candidates will also be affected, outperforming. For the purpose of ensuring quality and to help ensure that in this case, if the majority of the FSC setters are attacked in 21 verifications, in the genesis block, the team verified a range to guarantee the public chain's normal operation.

FON Smart Chain also supports EVM-compatible smart contracts and protocols. Cross-chain transfers and other communications are possible thanks to native support for interoperability：

- **Autonomous blockchain**: Provides safety and security through elected validators.
- **EVM-compatible**: Supports all the existing Ethereum tooling along with faster finality and cheaper transaction fees.
- **Interoperable**: Comes with efficient native dual chain communication; Optimized for scaling high-performance dApps that require fast and smooth user experience.
- **Distributed with on-chain governance**: Proof of Staked Authority brings in decentralization and community participants. As the native token, FON will serve as both the gas of smart contract execution and tokens for staking.

More details in [White Paper](https://docs.fonscan.io).

## Key features

### Proof of Staked Authority 
Although Proof-of-Work (PoW) has been approved as a practical mechanism to implement a decentralized network, it is not friendly to the environment and also requires a large size of participants to maintain the security. 

Proof-of-Authority(PoA) provides some defense to 51% attack, with improved efficiency and tolerance to certain levels of Byzantine players (malicious or hacked). 
Meanwhile, the PoA protocol is most criticized for being not as decentralized as PoW, as the validators, i.e. the nodes that take turns to produce blocks, have all the authorities and are prone to corruption and security attacks.

Other blockchains, such as EOS and Cosmos both, introduce different types of Deputy Proof of Stake (DPoS) to allow the token holders to vote and elect the validator set. It increases the decentralization and favors community governance. 


## Native Token

FON will run on FON Smart Chain in the same way as ETH runs on Ethereum so that it remains as `native token` for FSC. This means, 
FON will be used to pay `gas` to deploy or invoke Smart Contract on FSC

## Building the source

Many of the below are the same as or similar to go-ethereum.

For prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the [Installation Instructions](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/install-and-build/installing-geth).

Building `geth` requires both a Go (version 1.14 or later) and a C compiler. You can install
them using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run

```shell
make geth
```

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

```shell
make all
```

## Executables

The Fsc project comes with several wrappers/executables found in the `cmd`
directory.

|    Command    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :-----------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  **`geth`**   | Main FON Smart Chain client binary. It is the entry point into the FSC network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node (default), archive node (retaining all historical state) or a light node (retrieving data live). It has the same and more RPC and other interface as go-ethereum and can be used by other processes as a gateway into the FSC network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. `geth --help` and the [CLI page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/command-line-options) for command line options.          |
|   `clef`      | Stand-alone signing tool, which can be used as a backend signer for `geth`.  |
|   `devp2p`    | Utilities to interact with nodes on the networking layer, without running a full blockchain. |
|   `abigen`    | Source code generator to convert Ethereum contract definitions into easy to use, compile-time type-safe Go packages. It operates on plain [Ethereum contract ABIs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html) with expanded functionality if the contract bytecode is also available. However, it also accepts Solidity source files, making development much more streamlined. Please see our [Native DApps](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/dapp/native-bindings) page for details. |
|  `bootnode`   | Stripped down version of our Ethereum client implementation that only takes part in the network node discovery protocol, but does not run any of the higher level application protocols. It can be used as a lightweight bootstrap node to aid in finding peers in private networks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|     `evm`     | Developer utility version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that is capable of running bytecode snippets within a configurable environment and execution mode. Its purpose is to allow isolated, fine-grained debugging of EVM opcodes (e.g. `evm --code 60ff60ff --debug run`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|   `rlpdump`   | Developer utility tool to convert binary RLP ([Recursive Length Prefix](https://eth.wiki/en/fundamentals/rlp)) dumps (data encoding used by the Ethereum protocol both network as well as consensus wise) to user-friendlier hierarchical representation (e.g. `rlpdump --hex CE0183FFFFFFC4C304050583616263`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Running `geth`

Going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here (please consult our
[CLI Wiki page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/command-line-options)),
but we've enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly
on how you can run your own `geth` instance.

### Hardware Requirements

The hardware must meet certain requirements to run a full node.
- VPS running recent versions of Mac OS X or Linux.
- 1T of SSD storage for mainnet, 500G of SSD storage for testnet.
- 8 cores of CPU and 32 gigabytes of memory (RAM) for mainnet.
- 4 cores of CPU and 8 gigabytes of memory (RAM) for testnet.
- A broadband Internet connection with upload/download speeds of at least 10 megabyte per second

```shell
$ geth console
```

This command will:
 * Start `geth` in fast sync mode (default, can be changed with the `--syncmode` flag),
   causing it to download more data in exchange for avoiding processing the entire history
   of the FON Smart Chain network, which is very CPU intensive.
 * Start up `geth`'s built-in interactive [JavaScript console](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/javascript-console),
   (via the trailing `console` subcommand) through which you can interact using [`web3` methods](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/) 
   (note: the `web3` version bundled within `geth` is very old, and not up to date with official docs),
   as well as `geth`'s own [management APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/server).
   This tool is optional and if you leave it out you can always attach to an already running
   `geth` instance with `geth attach`.


### Configuration

As an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the `geth` binary, you can also pass a
configuration file via:

```shell
$ geth --config /path/to/your_config.toml
```

To get an idea how the file should look like you can use the `dumpconfig` subcommand to
export your existing configuration:

```shell
$ geth --your-favourite-flags dumpconfig
```

### Programmatically interfacing `geth` nodes

As a developer, sooner rather than later you'll want to start interacting with `geth` and the
FON Smart Chain network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid
this, `geth` has built-in support for a JSON-RPC based APIs ([standard APIs](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API)
and [`geth` specific APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/server)).
These can be exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (UNIX sockets on UNIX based
platforms, and named pipes on Windows).

The IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by `geth`,
whereas the HTTP and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a
subset of APIs due to security reasons. These can be turned on/off and configured as
you'd expect.

HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

  * `--http` Enable the HTTP-RPC server
  * `--http.addr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--http.port` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: `8545`)
  * `--http.api` API's offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--http.corsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests (browser enforced)
  * `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
  * `--ws.addr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--ws.port` WS-RPC server listening port (default: `8546`)
  * `--ws.api` API's offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--ws.origins` Origins from which to accept websockets requests
  * `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server
  * `--ipcapi` API's offered over the IPC-RPC interface (default: `admin,debug,eth,miner,net,personal,shh,txpool,web3`)
  * `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You'll need to use your own programming environments' capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to
connect via HTTP, WS or IPC to a `geth` node configured with the above flags and you'll
need to speak [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) on all transports. You
can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!

**Note: Please understand the security implications of opening up an HTTP/WS based
transport before doing so! Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert
FSC nodes with exposed APIs! Further, all browser tabs can access locally
running web servers, so malicious web pages could try to subvert locally available
APIs!**
